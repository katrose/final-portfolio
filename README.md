# Final Portfolio

The main goal of this portfolio was to learn [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) (React) and [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/).

## Plugins Used
- react-scroll
- react-reveal
- react-icons (for Font Awesome icons)
- Styled Components

## The Process

I started out with the basic Gatsby starter template... which pretty much had nothing in it.

So everything was basically done from scratch!
