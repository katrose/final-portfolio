# Final Portfolio

The main goal of this portfolio was to learn Gatsby and Styled Components.

## Plugins Used
- react-scroll
- react-reveal
- Styled Components
- Font Awesome

## The Process

I started out with the basic Gatsby starter template... which pretty much had nothing on it. So everything was basically done from scratch.
